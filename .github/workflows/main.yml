    # Personal access token (PAT) used to fetch the repository. The PAT is configured with the local git config, which enables your scripts to run authenticated git commands. The post-job step removes the PAT. We recommend using a service account with the least permissions necessary. Also when generating a new PAT, select the least scopes necessary.
